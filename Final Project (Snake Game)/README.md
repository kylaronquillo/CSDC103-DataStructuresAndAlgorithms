Console-Based Snake Game Project for CSDC103 Data Structures and Algorithms

PROGRAMMING PROJECT
SNAKE GAME

Objective
Implement the classic Snake game in C++ using various data structures and algorithms.

Game Mechanics
1. The snake moves through the grid, growing longer as it eats food.
   - Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
   - Update the snake's position based on its current direction.

2. Implement collision detection for the snake:
   - Check for collisions with the game borders.
   - Detect collisions with the snake's own body.

3. Randomly place food on the grid:
   - Ensure the food does not appear on the snake's body.
   - Update the score when the snake eats the food.

4. Implement game over conditions:
   - End the game if the snake collides with the borders or itself.
   
Additional Challenges (Optional)
1. Implement different levels with varying speeds:
   - Gradually increase the snake's speed as the player advances.

User Interface
Design a simple console-based interface for the game. Display the current score, level, and other relevant information.
